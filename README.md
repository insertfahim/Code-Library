# Code-Library
## 📚 Code Library

Welcome to my personal code library! 🌟 Here, I've compiled **almost all** the important templates you'll need for Competitive Programming (saying "almost" just for courtesy 😉). Most of these codes are originally written by me, and a few have been collected from others but modified for cleaner readability.

### 🚀 Journey to Completion
This library is the result of 4 years of dedication and learning. 📅 Each line of code represents a story of excitement, sleepless but fun nights, and a relentless pursuit of knowledge. 📖✨

### 🤔 Why am I sharing this library?
- **Smoothen Your Learning Path**: I hope this makes your journey a bit smoother. 🛤️
- **Knowledge Sharing**: Knowledge hidden away is of no use. Sharing it ensures it lives on. 🌍

### 💖 How to Support
You can make me happy (consider it a form of payment) by giving a star ⭐ to the repository. Your support means a lot!

### 🌟 Features
- **Clean and Readable Code**: My coding style focuses on clarity and readability. 🧼📜
- **Practice Links**: Many codes come with problem links so you can practice directly. 🔗📝

Best wishes, my friend! 💻💖
